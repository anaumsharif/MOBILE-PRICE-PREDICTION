# MOBILE-PRICE-PREDICTION

Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for classification tasks where the goal is to predict the probability that an instance of belonging to a given class.
Price estimation and prediction is an important part of consumer strategy.
Deciding on the correct price of a product is very important for the market success of a product.
Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable.
Therefore the outcome must be a categorical or discrete value. It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc.
But instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1.
